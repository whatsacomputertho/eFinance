## What's eFinance, Tho?:
This project is a semester project for Penn State's IST 412 course, "The Engineering of Complex Software Systems".  For our project, we are using the Spring Boot framework, which itself is composed of a few major components, namely an Apache Tomcat embedded server, MySQL Server 8.0 with Java Persistence API, and more.  The project is centered around a fictional company, ATZ Finance, for whom we were tasked with developing a comprehensive information system which can handle both front-office and back-office functions of the company.  We were given very vague instructions by design, since it is expected that we should partake in the end-to-end process involving requirements engineering, system design and prototyping, project management, and of course, development.  This GitHub repository is backing the actual software product which we have developed as a group over the course of the 2020-2021 Spring semester at Penn State University.
